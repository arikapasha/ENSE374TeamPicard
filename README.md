PROJECT IDEA

Our project is a music service, similar to IMDb, where users are able to rate and review the music they listen to. We will also allow users the option to create folders for their music so it is easier to sort and find songs (genre sorting, mood sorting, etc). 

PROJECT BACKGROUND/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

It is very hard for people to keep track of all the music they have listened to, and even harder to keep track of songs they once used to love a lot in the past. It is so frustrating trying to remember the name of songs and therefore, we decided to create a music database where users can track what songs they have listened to, rate these songs and decide whether they love or hate it. It is a good way for users to keep all the music they have listened to in one place and make it easier for them to find songs they really liked. It is also a good way for users to reflect back on their thoughts and opinions about certain music from their past. 

Not only is this helpful for users to post their opinion about music, but it is also useful for artists and producers to see if their music is doing well in terms of ratings.

Scrum comments & team responses[edit]
Sept.28, 2021 (Tim)
Project idea: A music DB similar to IMDB where people can rate music and make folders for likes, and recommendations
MVC design: A web interface - CS 215 technology
Customer/user group: Music lovers
Constraints: How music is being added to the DB
Tim's notes: Think about the scope and the "must-haves" vs the "nice-to-haves." Think about how you to store represent music. You can explore an API if one exists or come up with your POC.

Status: Green on docs, Yellow for Kanban and rationalized MVPs
Tim's notes: The team has refined the project scope to focus on rating and sorting music experiences. The how of it all will come out in Activity #2 (i.e. how to sort and by what attributes/tag). The team had no questions otherwise
