## Project Idea

Our project is a music service, similar to IMDb, where users are able to rate and review the music they listen to. We will also allow users the option to create folders for their music so it is easier to sort and find songs (genre sorting, mood sorting, etc). 

## Project Background/Business Opportunity

It is very hard for people to keep track of all the music they have listened to, and even harder to keep track of songs they once used to love a lot in the past. It is so frustrating trying to remember the name of songs and therefore, we decided to create a music database where users can track what songs they have listened to, rate these songs and decide whether they love or hate it. It is a good way for users to keep all the music they have listened to in one place and make it easier for them to find songs they really liked. It is also a good way for users to reflect back on their thoughts and opinions about certain music from their past. 

Not only is this helpful for users to post their opinion about music, but it is also useful for artists and producers to see if their music is doing well in terms of ratings.
